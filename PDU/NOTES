Get the outlet name for all outlets not connected to 'apc'

If the outlet has the same name as the host to which it is attached (where that makes sense) then this becomes a list of hosts to ping before cutting the main feed.

SQL --
select outlets.name from hosts,outlets where hosts.idx=outlets.hostidx and hosts.name<>'apc';
