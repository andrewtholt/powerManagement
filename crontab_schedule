# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# On or after 05:15 and 1 hour before sunrise
#
15 05 * * * /usr/local/bin/mosquitto_pub -t "/home/outside/PorchLight/power" -m ON
03 06 * * * /usr/bin/sunwait wait rise offset 0:45 ; /usr/local/bin/mosquitto_pub -t "/home/outside/PorchLight/power" -m OFF
# 
# Just in case:
# 
30 09 * * * /usr/local/bin/mosquitto_pub -t "/home/outside/PorchLight/power" -m OFF 
#
# On after 16:30 and 1 hour before sunset
# 30 16 * * * /usr/bin/sunwait wait set offset 1:00:00 ; /usr/local/bin/mosquitto_pub -t "/home/outside/PorchLight/power" -m ON
# 
30 16 * * * /usr/bin/sunwait wait set offset 1:00:00  ; /usr/local/bin/mosquitto_pub -t "/home/outside/PorchLight/power" -m ON
# 
# Off after 23:30
# 
30 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/mosquitto_pub -t "/home/outside/PorchLight/power" -m OFF
