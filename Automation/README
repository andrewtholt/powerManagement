Simple logic engine akin to a instruction list PLC

IO points are define in data.txt

DAY:/home/environment/day:IN:TRUE:TRUE:FALSE
PorchLight:/home/outside/PorchLight/power:OUT:OFF:ON:OFF

The fields are:

Name
MQTT topic
Direction
Initial state (can be blank)
True message    If the state is true send this to make the topic true.
False message   If the state is false send this to make the topic false.

And the logic 'program' is by default in logic.txt and

LDN DAY
OUT PorchLight
END

So if DAY changes state from TRUE to FALSE, PorchLight will change from OFF to ON.

This is held in a datbase the schema for which is in setup.sql

To reset the DB use:

./loader.py -v -c -i ./data.txt
